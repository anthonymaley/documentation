## Emerging Products


## Vouch Identity App Proposal

To make our product viable for July sales and October usage, we need to rebuild and redesign the Vouch Identity base application.

The following screens illustrate (roughly) how the app should operate and what the functionality should be.

This is still **very draft** at present and through conversation as a team we can define and agree these features in detail.

The screens are only conceptual work by Tony at present, Full UI/UX design has still to be completed by Daniel.

### Splash Screen

To be shown on app launch after install or restart of application only.

</p>

### SMS Invite

This functionality remains the same.

</p>


### SMS On-boarding

These screens are Identical to the existing app and the functionality remains the same also.

</p>

### Apple Watch Approval

In a similar way to how Apple levarage the Apple Watch to authenticate access, i would like to mirror this capability for Vouch.

This would be active if watch is active and paired to device with Vouch installed and would prompt user for watch approval over a prompt on the device as a priority.

</p>

### Home Screen / Main Navigation

Inspired by Vouch Key Automotive, we can offer a similar UI/UX for navigation and controls.

<p align="center">
  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Home.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Home Screen"/>
</p>

### Browser Scan

The initial control view will be the browser scan function as this is likely the first thing a new user will need to link their identity to a browser to use Vouch.

Pressing QR Icon would then activate camera for scanning.

  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Scan.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Scan Screen"/>
</p>

### Access Sharing

Inspired by Vouch Key Automotive, we can offer a similar sharing capability for website/app access.

This capability will be important for our Vouch Identity Content Providers vertical offering, where access to a specific resource will be possible, just like a car, we can share access to Netflix/Hbo type platforms.

However, as yet, this functionality has not been detailed or designed for general usage as of yet, but would be a great feature if we could pull it off.

### Initial Sharing

The initial sharing screen should allow the user to select existing contact or add a new one.

<p align="center">
  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Sharing.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Sharing Screen"/>
</p>

### Set Options

This screen will offer options to select which access privilege to share and whether or not they can re-share.

<p align="center">
  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Sharing2.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Sharing Screen"/>

  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Sharing3.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Sharing Screen"/>
</p>
### Set Date Range

This screen will allow a start and end date range to be set. Access should not be possible outside of these dates.

<p align="center">
  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Sharing5.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Sharing Screen"/>
</p>

### Revoke Access Share

This feature should revoke a shared access grant.

<p align="center">
   <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/Sharing4.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Sharing Screen"/>
 </p>


### History

We have had this on our feature list for 18 months but have yet to realize it. If its possible we should list out the last X uses of the identity.

<p align="center">
  <img style='border:1px solid #000000' src="/assets/product/proposals/identity/History.png" width='450' alt="Vouch Identity Sharing Screen"/>
</p>

### User Profile
