## Design History

### Vouch Design Language History

### Vouch Logo History

#### Our first logo - July 2018

Cameron and I had seen a Bentley at an NMSDC show in Austin, TX and the seats had these embedded lines in the leather, conveying motion and quality. We used this concept as an input to our design consultant Joe, who iterated ideas until we settled on the below:

  <img style='border:0px solid #000000' src="/assets/design/History/1stlogo.png" width='650' alt="First Vouch Logo"/>
</p>

We also designed a 'bug' logo to be used on websites and content.\

  <img style='border:0px solid #000000' src="/assets/design/History/1stlogobug.png" width='250' alt="First Vouch Bug"/>
</p>

#### 2nd Iteration - September 2019

The second logo came from Daniel, who had just joined the team. He took a view of refreshing the logo to fit within the design language he was trying to put in place quickly, in line with the content we had developed around the idea that Vouch as dIAM platform.\

</p>

#### 3rd Iteration - May 2020

The current logo was created by Daniel with the focus on Vouch Identity and Vouch Key as the main product lines.

### Vouch App Design History

#### Initial App Design - July 2018

Most of the design came from a combination of Anthony and Joe. The UX/UI layout was mostly done by Anthony and Joe then applied the design.

The brief on the design was to be friendly and approachable, as opposed to most security products. Anthony had the idea of using character to achieve this and Joe created our Vouch Dude character.

#### Refreshed App Design - September 2019

Daniel partnered with Anthony to refresh the design of the App with the dIAM approach.

We increased the corporate look and feel to support this approach and reduced the complexity of a few of the features.

```{r 8.2.4, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Refreshed App Design", fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("History/refreshedapp.png")
```

#### Current App Design - June 2020

The current app design encompasses the focus to Vouch Identity and Vouch Key product lines.

```{r 8.2.5, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Current App Design", fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("History/currentapp.png")
```
