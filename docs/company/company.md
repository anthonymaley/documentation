### Vouch is...

In an ever more digitally connected world, where digital devices and services blend seamlessly into our daily lives, proving who we say we are in the digital world has become increasingly difficult. With devices full of security applications, tokens and documents filled with usernames and passwords, managing our digital identities has become unreliable, and in many cases insecure and unsafe. Founded in 2018, Vouch began with an idea, an idea to solve this problem, an idea to make digital security simple, safe and secure for people and devices for a safer, connected future.

**Vouch, a connected world of possibility.**
As a group of people who love to share ideas and knowledge and expertise, collaborating to drive innovation and build breakthrough products, the best part of building Vouch is working towards a vision that we all believe in – “A safer, connected future.” Our vision and driving principles keep us all focused on our mission, forming the soul of the company which is reflected in every interatcion with us.

### Our Driving Principles

**Integrity**
Be real. We believe in working hard to deliver a game-changing product, experience and company. We are by nature a competitive company, but we compete by offering a better alternative, not by denigrating or otherwise undercutting the competition.

**Passion to innovate**
Computing is our shared passion; our calling is to evaluate and advance the state of the art, bringing those advances to the broadeast possible audience.

**Authenticity and transparency**
We’re honest, open and always transparent. We tell the truth at all times and maintain an ethos of being true to ourselves as well as our mission, communicating openly with others be they customer, colleague, community or competitor.

**Responsibility**
We feel a duty to things larger than ourselves. We don’t merely fulfill our obligations, but actively seek ways we can help.

**Simplicity**
Whilst we work with complex problems and solutions, we don’t hide behind jargon or self beneficial statements. We operate to make security in the connected world accessible to all through simplification.

### Our History

After many years of performing transformational CTO/Chief Architect/Enterprise Architect etc. roles for companies such as Toyota Europe, AGCO, Sun Trust (now Truist), FISERV etc. Frustrated with creating products for those companies and having to sell the innovation internally before we could even build the products for our companies customers. Our team wanted make their own product and bring that to the market.\

At the same time, Sidd had built VDart to be a highly successful company and was looking to branch out into Digital Services and product development.

We where introduced and hit it off, a shared vision and shared principles, we decided to partner and build VDart Digital and look for clients for digital services. Initially we found this difficult but managed to find Toyota as a major client which has been highly successful and instrumental in growing that company. Separate to this, we defined our product idea for Vouch and then the company Vouch.io was born.
