### How it all began
After many years of performing transformational CTO/Chief Architect/Enterprise Architect etc. roles for companies such as Toyota Europe, AGCO, Sun Trust (now Truist), FISERV etc. Frustrated with creating products for those companies and having to sell the innovation internally before we could even build the products for our companies customers. Our team wanted make their own product and bring that to the market.

At the same time, Sidd had built VDart to be a highly successful company and was looking to branch out into Digital Services and product development.

We were introduced and hit it off, a shared vision and shared principles, we decided to partner and build VDart Digital and look for clients for digital services. Initially we found this difficult but managed to find Toyota as a major client which has been highly successful and instrumental in growing that company. Separate to this, we defined our product idea for Vouch and then the company Vouch.io was born.

### Product Developement

Our original ideas for product where withing the IoT, AI and Machine Learning areas but we could not trust the devices that we would have to connect to or the indivduals accessing them, so we took a step back and tried to solve this aspect first. This led to the breakthrough that has became the Vouch product.
